					<h1>Verification of mismatched base pairs</h1>
					<p>
						In the design of DNAWalker, mismatched base pairs were incorporated into the base sequence in order to block undesired reaction pathways. In experiment A, we confirmed that the mismatched base pair worked as expected. Fig. 2 shows the results of experiment A. In pattern A in Fig. 2, output was released because the fluorescence intensity increased. Thus, double-stranded DNA (S1-W1) and single-stranded DNA (F1) underwent a strand displacement reaction. In pattern B in Fig. 2, output was not released because the fluorescence intensity had not changed from the initial time. Thus, double-stranded DNA (S1-W1) and single-stranded DNA (F2) did not react with each other due to mismatch base pairing between S1 and F1. Likewise, in pattern C, output was emitted due to the strand displacement reaction of S2-W2 and F2, and the fluorescence intensity was increased. In pattern D, we expected that the reaction of S2-W2 and F1 would not occur thanks to mismatched base pairing between S2 and F1. However, it was impossible to obtain a result similar to pattern B.

						From, the results of experiment A, we assumed that Reporter1 and F1 had reacted directly, and we therefore conducted a verification experiment of Reporter1 and F1. From the results of the verification experiment (Fig. 3), when F1 was administered, fluorescence intensity increased as expected. Therefore, we conducted verification of patterns Aâ€“D using electrophoresis.
