					<p>Biosafety and risk assessment issues (absence of comparative control, etc.)</p>

						We propose a method to transport structures made of DNA origami using a structure called DNA Walker, in which a power mechanism for transportation was connected with a DNA origami structure. This DNA Walker was constructed by combining artificially generated nucleotides. In the future, this system may allow drug delivery systems powered by DNA Walker to be incorporated into the body. If the reaction system is closed within the artificial nucleotide, even if an unintended reaction occurs, the body will not be affected. However, if the system mistakenly reacts with the DNA present in the body, the body may be affected. Current knowledge suggests that DNA in the body and artificial nucleotides do not react; however, this may change in the future. Thus, design of such systems should be performed while considering countermeasures. Additionally, in the above example, we assumed a case in which DNA Walker carried a box-shaped DNA structure containing therapeutic drugs inside the body, but is the drug were to become harmful rather than therapeutic, safety would be compromised. If DNA Walker were exploited to carry cargo containing harmful substances to specific organs and designed to release cargo into organs, serious health problems could occur. Therefore, if the transport system proposed in this study were to be applied in the clinical setting, there may be both advantages and disadvantages.
