						We propose a way to transport structures made of DNA origami.
						It is a structure called DNAWalker in which a power mechanism for transportation is connected to a DNA origami structure.
						This Walker is created by combining artificially generated nucleotides.
						In the future, it is assumed that DDS powered by DNAWalker has been incorporated into the body.
						If the reaction system is closed within the artificial nucleotide, even if an unintended reaction occurs, it will not affect the human body.
						However, if it mistakenly reacts with DNA present in the body, it may have a big impact on the human body.
						Currently, it is thought that DNA in the body and artificial nucleotide do not react, but specifications may change in the future and it may become responsive.
						Design should be done while considering measures from the current stage.
						Also, in the above example, we assumed a case where Walker carries a box-shaped DNA structure containing therapeutic drugs in the body, but when it becomes a harmful substance rather than a therapeutic drug, a new danger is created.
						If Walker were to be exploited to carry a box containing harmful substances up to a specific organ and to be designed to open boxes in organs, serious problems related to human life and death would arise.
						Therefore, if the transport system proposed this time is to be incorporated as part of the application, it should be considered carefully because it is considered that it has not only a positive side but also a negative side.
