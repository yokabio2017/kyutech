					<p>
						We designed a system to move the DNA origami structure via DNAWalker, as was previously described [1]. DNAWalker is a structure in which two DNA strands are partially hybridized, and each single strand represents a leg. In addition, the scaffolds are designed to form partial complementary sequences in a hairpin structure so that they do not bind, even if fuel DNA is added. However, S1 and S2 had exactly the same base sequence, and it is not known whether the DNAWalker reaction proceeds from the left foot or the right foot. The DNAWalker would be dangling when it moves forward from the right foot (w2), resulting in an undesired reaction system. As a solution to this problem, we utilized mismatched base pairs. Specifically, we replaced a sequence with one that was not fully complementary to ensure that unintended chains did not bind to each other. When chains joined to form a double strand, since there were many complimentary combinations in each strand, they were combined, and the combination was intentionally reduced to make it uncoupled.
					</p>
					<p>
						The principle of DNAWalker with a mismatched base pair is explained below. Mismatched base pairs were incorporated into the base sequence to satisfy the specifications indicated in Table 1. The symbol ◯ indicates a successful combination, and the X symbol indicates that the components were not successfully combined. For example, S1 and F1 were coupled, whereas S1 and F2 were not.

						First, the left leg (W1) and right foot (W2) were combined in different arrangements; DNAWalker scaffolds were arranged in different steps, as described below, and the left leg (W1) and S1, followed by the right leg (W2) were designed.  F1 and S1 combined to dissociate W1, and dissociated W1 and S2 then combined to move DNAWalker. The detailed reaction procedure is described in eight steps below.
