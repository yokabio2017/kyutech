					<h1>Abstract</h1>

					<p>
						Here, we propose a method for the development of DNA nanostructures that autonomously move in a single direction. A structure called a DNAWalker, in which two DNA strands were partially bound and a single-stranded region was present at both ends of the double-stranded portion, was used in this method. The DNAWalker ran on double-stranded DNA (Ground) in which single-stranded DNA (Spot) of the same base sequence with a hairpin structure was continuously arranged. The DNAWalker used its single-strand region as a toehold, induced a strand displacement reaction at a particular Spot, and then moved to the next Spot. Next, the strand displacement reaction between the DNAWalker and Spot occurred again, and the DNAWalker spontaneously traveled on the Ground. Since the progress of the DNAWalker depended on the initial concentration of fuel DNA, progress could be controlled by adjusting the initial concentration. We added mismatched base pairs to the nucleotide sequence of the DNAWalker to avoid an unintended reaction pathway. In addition, we changed the structure of the DNAWalker to connect to the DNA origami, making it available as a force to move the DNA origami structure; accordingly, this portion was designated the “Transporter”.

					<h1>Project Idea</h1>
					<p>
						We created a system that functioned as a power source for moving DNA structures. We considered a system in which the structure to be moved and the power source were separate, rather than one in which the DNA structure to be moved and its power source were united. In this framework, even if the DNA structure was changed according to the specifications of the application, movement was possible as long as a connection with the power source was made. Therefore, the aim of this project was to design a system that functioned as a power source. The proposed power source must satisfy the following four specifications. First, this system must be able to connect to the target DNA structure. Second, this system must be able to move autonomously. Third, since DNA molecules are in Brownian motion in solution, they move in all directions; therefore, this system should move in a single direction. Fourth, this system must be able to adjust its progress. Accordingly, we built a system that satisfied these four specifications with reference to the principle of operation of a structure called a DNAWalker <sup>[2]</sup>.

								Our goal is to realize a method for the development of a structure showing autonomous movement in a single direction. We divide the goal into eight steps, and of these eight steps, we have finished up to six steps. We will continue to work toward completing the remaining steps.
